This consists of games, written in different languages.

There is a user input game where the user and the computer banter in an attempt to guess the lucky number.

The number is generated randomly, so even the creator will not always win.

There is also a game where the user and the computer speak about the age they will pass away.

These games are fun small things to showcase my abilities in different languages.
